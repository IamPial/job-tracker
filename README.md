### What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

\*\*1. getElementById() : getElementById is a unique key used to find just a single element or section or a div element.

\*\*2. getElementsByClassName() : GetElementByClassName is how I can find multiple sections or divs or elements with the same class name.

\*\*3. querySelector: By Using query selectors, we can find out how many child elements are inside a parent element using a query selector.

\*\*4. querySelectorAll: By Using the querySelectorAll we can get all the sections or div elements as an array, which gives me a nodelist.
